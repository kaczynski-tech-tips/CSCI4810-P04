Task 1 : included "palletes" folder showing .ppm outputs of 4 palettes.
Task 2 : could not implement cube. I tried to implement planes that would be built
            into a cube, but I ran out of time.
Task 3 : same as Task 2.
Task 4 : Multiple spheres are displayed in scene.
Task 5 : Anti-aliasing implemented.
Task 6 : Diffuse material and reflective (metal) material implemented and displayed 
            in scene.
